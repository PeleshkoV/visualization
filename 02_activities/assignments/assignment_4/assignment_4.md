# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify:  

My choice: Ontario top baby names (female)
https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/ontario-top-baby-names-female

Answers for both visualizations  

    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?  
    For creating data visualizations, I have used the Python.

    > Who is your intended audience?    
    The intended audience is the readers of the article in the popular women's magazine/website or readers of the demographic science magazine.  
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization?   
    Ontario is a multinational region so there are live people with thousands of different names.    
    If you want to choose a good name for your female baby, you can find a popular one or something very rare. This exploration can help you to make a choice. 

    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots?   
    I was considering all three principles. It was important for me that the diagrams looked aesthetically and were easy to perceive. For example, for the first diagram, I have chosen pink as the dominant color like a symbol of newborn girls. I complemented this color with grey text, as one of the most harmonious color combinations. I also tested several colormap options in the Wordcloud diagram to choose one that has shades of pink and is contrasting enough for people with visual disabilities to understand. When creating the diagram, I also evaluated it from a substantive point of view. I tried to make the diagrams as simple and understandable for the audience as possible. For instance, I complemented the visualization with text annotations.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization?     
    For reproducibility, I have created the visualizations in Python. Everybody can check or change my data and reproduce the plots with a set of codes. Otherwise, without using the program tools, it would be difficult to verify and recreate the same visualization.  
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    I have checked my visualizations with the Color Blindness Simulator. Both of them are accessible for people with eye disability. 
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    My visualizations might be interesting for families who are waiting for a female newborn and choosing the right name. Also, it's interesting to know for many people how unique their names. 
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization?  
    I selected the data according to the questions I chose to research. 
    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    - Government representatives who have managed the data collection;  
    - Lawyers who ensured the protection of personal data;  
    - IT support staff who helped to gather and process the data;
    - IT professionals who develop visualization tools in Python;
    - Designers created color palettes for visualizations;
    - Internet companies that provide access to web resources.

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
