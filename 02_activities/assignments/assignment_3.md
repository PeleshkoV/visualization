# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable.

New knowledge allows me to change my opinion about this visualization a little bit.  
- From some point of view, this visualization may be not equitable. The pink color is absolutely dominant in the picture and stereotypically associated with the female gender. It makes visualization not equal for other genders.  
- I checked this picture at Color BLIndness Simulator. In my opinion, the result is not bad. The shades of pink are recognizable for people with different eye disorders. Additionally, the author added pop-up descriptions to the visual elements. It can help people to perceive information through the text. 
- As I have already mentioned in the previous assignment, it could be useful to increase the contrast of the colors on this visualization to make it more readable.     
- The author gives us information about the source of the data for this analysis, but it's only the name of the government organization, without details. We can't check and reproduce this information. I guess, the author used some programs and codes for reproducibility.

- This visualization doesn't have a problem with equitability. It describes Social media in unbiased way.
- The test at Color BLIndness Simulator showed that for the people with some eye disorder the color set is not recognizable, because some colors are pretty similar to each other. For this people it will be hard to understand the data. Although, the contrast of the colors is good. At the same time, visualizations doesn't have enough descriptions.
- This picture includes a link for the resourse of the data which is enough for reproducing visualizations.    

    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?

I see a few ways for improving:
- add other colors to the visualization (except pink) to escape gender discrimination;
- increase the contrast for the text and visual elements;
- provide some details about data resources.

- Add more descriptions with numerical data to the visualizations. It will make it more accessible.  
- Change the colors of some objects to make them more clear for the people wth some eye disorders. 


- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
